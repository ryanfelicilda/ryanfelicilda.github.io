				<h4>ABOUT ME:</h4>
					I am a self-motivated, energetic and results driven professional with extensive experience in the fields of electrical engineering and meteorology in the U.S. Air Force and private sectors. Iâ€™ve been characterized as a hands-on problem-solver with the keen ability to bring quick and effective solutions by establishing goals, prioritizing tasks, and leading by example.<br><br>

					Throughout my professional career, I have developed all of the qualities you look for in a leader. I understand and apply innovative solutions for continuous improvement; yet I realize that it is people who ultimately deliver results, and I am strongly focused on building relationships with employers, managers, vendors, and clients as a primary tool for organizational success. I am willing to face challenges head-on, work hard, and get the job done right the first time. It's this difference that I will bring to my new role each day as I look toward taking even greater responsibilities to enact positive change.<br><br>

					My objective is to obtain a position in the U.S. or overseas where I can apply my 13+ years of professional experience to positively impact your business by helping you tackle its profitability, productivity, quality, and cost challenges. If you feel your business can benefit from someone with my background and expertise, contact me to discuss the contributions I can make.
